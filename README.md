**PORTFOLIO**
This HTML code creates a webpage for showcasing a portfolio of albums. It includes a navigation bar, a header introducing the album collection, an introduction section with descriptive text, and a section displaying individual album cards. Each album card contains an image, title, and a button to toggle the display of track listings. The footer includes copyright information. Additionally, there are JavaScript functions for toggling track list visibility and closing content, as well as links to Bootstrap and custom script files.

The CSS code provides styling for the portfolio page. It defines background colors, text colors, positioning for elements, and styles for the toggle functionality. It also includes styles for the footer to ensure it stays fixed at the bottom of the page.
